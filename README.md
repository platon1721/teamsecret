	<h1>Team Secret</h1>
	<p>Team Secret is a European professional Dota 2 team.</p>
	<h2>History of Formation</h2>
	<p>After Natus Vincere and Fnatic both underperformed at The International 2014, two key members of the two organizations, Kuroky and N0tail, respectively, had an idea for a team that was run by the players, not beholden to any esports organization. Kuroky brought on his friend and teammate on Na'Vi, Puppey, while N0tail brought on his friend and teammate, Fly. They rounded out their roster with Alliance midlaner s4, whose team similarly underperformed at TI4. The roster made their public debut in the qualifiers for Star Ladder Star Series Season 10.<p>
	<h2>Active roster</h2>
	<p>Today's roster of Team Secret, is playing togethere already more than 2 years.YapzOr joined in 2017, Nisha and zai joined the team in September 11th 2018 to complete the roster for the 2018/19 DPC season. The last one MATUMBAMAN, who is playing the carry role had come in 2019 after the TI9.<p>
